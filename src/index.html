                            Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health. By reducing air pollution levels,
                            countries can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both
                            chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.

                            Reducing outdoor air pollution also reduces emissions of CO2 and short-lived climate

                                        Air pollutants are substances suspended in air that are damaging to the health
                                        of
                                        humans.
                                        Many pollutants are a direct result of human activity, including motor vehicle
                                        exhaust,
                                        industrial processes, power plant emissions, agricultural burning and forest
                                        fires.

                        Nowhere is the problem more more severe or impact more people than Asia. In China, India,
                        Pakistan, and Bangladesh alone, 3 billion people are breathing highly toxic air. These
                        people have
                        no way to protect themselves, or their families. Most concerning of all is that the problem

                    We have already seen that air pollution varies significantly from one country to the next, but even
                    within countries the differences can be large. These variation can be due to human factors such as
                    the siting of industrial infrastructure and power generation or a result of natural factors such as
                    local geography and weather patterns.

                    Building a more complete picture of how and where air pollution is impacting human health requires
                    us to analyse air quality at the city level. The visualization below shows one of the most
                    comprehensive datasets of city level air pollution availabe, comprising data from more than 1500
                    cities across the globe.

                    Have you ever seen news reports about polluted cities in China or India and wondered how bad the air
                    really is? How it compares to the air you breathe everyday?<br>
                    Perhaps you are considering moving to a new city and want to know how the clean the air is for your

                    The comparison chart lets you compare differences in air quality between different cities based on
                    both PM2.5 and PM10 data.

                                contributers to particulate matter pollution. The correlation between energy production
                                from coal and average country pm2.5 does not appear clear, as individual factors such as
                                climate, and location of power generation may have a stronger impact. Data at the city

                                The detailed analysis of air pollution presented above was only possible because so many
                                countries have recognized this as a serious issue and have invested in the monitoring
                                equipment needed to record air quality.

                                North America and Europe have extensive and well established networks of monitoring
                                stations which help citizens stay informed about air pollution in their area. China and
                                India deserve credit for deploying large numbers of stations in recent years as their
                                pollution problem has become more critical.

                                understand the risks posed by air pollutions. Further measurements in South America,
                                Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also needed.
