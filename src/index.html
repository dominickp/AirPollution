                        Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health. By reducing air pollution levels,
                        countries can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both
                        chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.

                        Some 88% of premature deaths caused by air pollution occurred in low- and middle-income
                        countries, and the greatest number in the WHO Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions.

                        Reducing outdoor air pollution also reduces emissions of CO2 and short-lived climate pollutants

                            then
                            you may not be aware of the unfolding health crisis caused by air pollution.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every day, billions of people are forced to breathe air deemed unsafe by the World Health
                            Organization and millions are dying every year as a result.

                        <h3>What is air pollution?</h3>


                        <p>
                            Air pollutants are substances suspended in air that are damaging to the health of humans.
                            Many pollutants are a direct result of human activity, including motor vehicle exhaust,
                            industrial processes, power plant emissions, agricultural burning and forest fires. <br><br>
                            These activities release a host of pollutants into the air we breathe, including:
                            Particulate Matter (PM), ground level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, lead, and
                            nitrogen dioxide.<br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h3>Particulate Matter</h3>
                        <p>
                            Fine particulate pollution (PM2.5), consists of particles 2.5 micrometers in diameter or
                            less which are small enough to pass through the lungs and into the bloodstream. This makes
                            PM2.5 pollution particularly dangerous for human health and has been liked to premature
                            death from heart and lung disease.<br>

                <h3>Air pollution: A growing problem around the world</h3>

                <p>
                    Nowhere is the problem more more severe or impact more people than Asia. In China, India,
                    Pakistan, and Bangladesh alone, 3 billion people are breathing highly toxic air. These
                    people have
                    no way to protect themselves, or their families. Most concerning of all is that the problem
                    is
                    <a class="action" id="intro_1">getting worse </a>at an alarming rate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a class="action" id="intro_2">Southeast Asia</a>, until recently a region with relatively
                    clean air has seen a worrying deterioration in air quality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even in developed regions such as the <a class="action" id="intro_3">United States </a>and
                    <a
                            class="action" id="intro_4">Europe </a>, where significant progress has been made to
                    improve
                    air quality, <a href="http://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/key-findings/"
                                    target="_blank">research </a>shows that air quality is damaging the health
                    of

                        href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015/premature-deaths-attributable-to-air-pollution"

                    pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is an urgent global problem that cannot be solved by countries working alone. Take the
                    case
                    of <a class="action" id="intro_5">Singapore </a>which has seen dramatic and hard won
                    improvements in air quality partly wiped out by smoke from illegal burning of forest and
                    agricultural land in neighboring Indonesia.

                    We have already seen that air pollution varies significantly from one country to the next, but even
                    within countries the differences can be large. These variation can be due to human factors such as
                    the siting of industrial infrastructure and power generation or a result of natural factors such as
                    local geography and weather patterns.

                    Building a more complete picture of how and where air pollution is impacting human health requires

                            Those living in highly polluted cities regularly face periods of acute air pollution which
                            can reach
                            10 or 20 times the WHO guideline levels, and the vast majority have not effective means of
                            protecting their health from the serious and often fatal side effects. In these cities, the

                            compares.
                            While this provides a useful indicator to compare average conditions between cities, it

                    that it does not benefit from the coastal sea breeze effect that moderates particulate matter in
                    other Indian cities.
