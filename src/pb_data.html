                The central visualization for Act 1 shows air pollution data for various cities and countries using
            horizontal bars layered out in a stacked gantt chart style. All of the data for this visualization is
            contained in the following WHO data file:
            </p>

            <p>The main air pollution visualization will be followed by three subsections which allow the reader to

                        pollution
                        issues that people face, especially in very polluted cities. This data will help us tell the

                        air pollution over a year in Beijing and Delhi, focusing on the extreme pollution events

                        too common and especially dangerous to our health.

            <p>In the final act we bring the reader back to think about their home town and what they can do to both
            protect their health from air pollution, and what actions can be taken to help reduce the problem. No
            data visualizations are proposed for this section, but information from the Environmental
            Protection Agency and other sources of advice on air pollution will be used.</p>

            <h4>20 Leading Causes of Death <span class="badge">April 10th</span> </h4>

            <p>
                The Causes of Death data was already structured and cleaned by the WHO organization. We only
                modified the data by adding information of air pollution. There were two tables; the data of 2000
                and 2012. The 2000 data was dropped completely.

            <p>
                <strong> Deaths per 100.000</strong><br>
                Because the 3.7 million deaths caused by air pollution are diagnosed as other diseases (source),
                those deaths had to be removed from the totals of the individual diseases to prevent duplicate
                deaths. The removed counts were added as separate rows with air pollution as their parent. Because
                of this, it is possible to zoom into the air pollution numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>% Deaths</strong><br>
                After the total deaths (Deaths per 100.000) were recalculated, the percentages were updated to keep
                the data consistent.

            <p>
                We performed an initial check to see which country level metrics available from the World Bank would offer interesting insights for the user. We used Tableau as a tool to perform this analysis because it makes it easy to perform rapid testing of chart results before we jump into coding.
