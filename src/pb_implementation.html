            <h3>Build Automation and Project Bootstrapping</h3>
            <p>
                We decided that we wanted to try our best to follow modern Javascript development best-practices.
                This included bootstrapping our project with build automation tools and test integration. Before we
                could start that process, we chose to host our project on GitHub. GitHub will not only host our web
                page but will also handle all version control. We started a new repository at this location:
                <a href="https://github.com/free-radicals/AirPollution">https://github.com/free-radicals/AirPollution</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these technologies use Node.js to run, which is a Javascript runtime that runs on a local
                computer. Node has a package manager called NPM. Within NPM, we initialized the project, allowing us
                to add project dependencies. We first added Gulp, which is a task-runner for Node. Once Gulp was in
                the repo, we configured it to run JShint, Karma, Jasmine, a CSS minifier, a JS uglifier, Browserify,
                and live-reload server.
            </p>
            <p>
                JShint is a linter that will alert us if we write any Javascript code that is non-standard or
                error-prone. Karma is a test runner which is configured to run Jasmine tests, used for providing
                test coverage in our code. We use gulp to move the source copy of our HTML file to the /dist/
                directory of our repo. At the same time, we copy all CSS into the /dist/ repo, minifying it at the
                same time to reduce the overall payload. Similarly, our Javascript is bundled up in Browserify,
                minified, then copied over to /dist/, where the HTML file references it locally. Browserify is nice
                because it allows us to make our code modular, so we don’t have to cram all of our logic in a single
                file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the live-reload server allows us to navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to see the current
                copy of our application. If any changes are made, this page automatically refreshes. Additionally,
                Gulp repeats most processes when any code changes occur, so if we introduce a bug in the code it
                will be caught by JShint or Karma and would show in the live-reload server instantly.<br><br>

                Now we can easily write quality Javascript code with a lot of tools on our side ensuring we see
                mistakes being introduced as soon as they happen. All of this (once configured) can be activated
                easily by typing “gulp” from the project directory:
                <img class="thumbnail processImg" src="img/implementation1.png" alt="gulp"/>

            </p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>

                <b>Reason</b><br>
                For the Introduction, we added the country data of multiple years to show that air pollution
                is still an important issue today.
                <br>
                After further development, the question: "How is the earth doing as a whole?" came in mind.
                We decided to answer that question by adding a transition to show a bar chart, showing how the global
                population is doing compared to 1990.<br><br>

                <b>Interaction</b><br>
                There are a few different ways to interact with the visualization:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clicking lines</strong> to pin them down and make it easier to compare the different
                    countries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hovering over lines in the chart</strong> to get information about that country.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Searching countries using typeahead</strong> to find specific countries in the
                    visualization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hovering over text-elements</strong> to instantly show what findings are talked about in the
                    story.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clicking the button underneath the visualization</strong> to show how the population as a
                    whole is doing.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Act 1: Air</h3>
            <p>

                <b>Reason</b><br>
                Because the All cities visualization shows all city points, it is hard to just compare a few interssting
                cities. to be able to do this, this visualization is made. user can now compare different cities they
                have lived in, compare it to delhi or beijing or other cities they find interesting.

                <li>
                    <strong>Selecting cities</strong> to draw them on the axis. this lets you compare it to other
                    selected cities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Selecting PM10 or PM2.5</strong> to show information about different kinds of pollution.

            <h3>Act 1: All cities</h3>
            <p>

                <b>Reason</b><br>
                We wanted to show more data than we did at the time, to make an easy comparison with the different
                cities in our dataset. Showing all our datapoints also gives the reader the feeling that our data is
                comprehensive.

            <h3>Act 1: Beijing & Delhi</h3>
            <p>

                <b>Reason</b><br>
                Our section “A year in the life of Beijing’s air” will take readers through a year of pollution,
                highlighting the impact it has on the daily lives of its residents. This is done to conceptualize the
                meaning of high air pollution.

                At the end we show a rotating map with the selected country on it using a pulsating marker. this is
