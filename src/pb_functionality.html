            <h3>Tasks</h3>

            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <span class="label label-default">Filter</span>
                    The initial view presented to the reader will show pollution data filtered for their city of choice.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <span class="label label-default">Navigate</span>
                    After the reader sees information about his city, the visualization zooms out to show information about the whole country. Additionally, when the user clicks on a country, they will be presented with the underlying city level detail.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <span class="label label-default">Select</span>
                    The reader will be able select additional countries to add to the visualization. This will provide the flexibility for the user to choose which country comparisons are most relevant or interesting.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <span class="label label-default">Sort</span>
                    The bar chart with the countries can be sorted based on PM2.5 or PM10.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <span class="label label-default">Determine Range</span>
                    The visual encoding we have chosen uses bars to represent the range of pollution for each country. We think this is an important metric and therefore it is presented using the very effective position encoding.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <span class="label label-default">Coordinate</span>
                    The city that is picked when you enter the page is the main focus of all visualizations. It is the city that will be explored in the beginning, the country that will be used to compare to well known polluters and the city that will be the main focus on the map.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <span class="label label-default">Coordinate</span>
                    TIn the section “Behind the numbers: factors contributing to pollution” readers will be able to explore coordinated scatter plots showing PM2.5 vs 9 different metrics such as % fossil fuel use, % forestry in country. We also plan to include functionality for simultaneous highlighting and filtering.
