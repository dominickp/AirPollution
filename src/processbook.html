                <h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Overview</b><br>
                    Our project will guide people on an exploration of air pollution starting in their home city and
                    expanding to include analysis at the national and international level. This we hope will provide our
                    readers with an engaging tool to inform themselves about how air pollution varies around the world,
                    what are the health impacts, and what can be done about it.<br><br>
                    We decided to put the reader at the center of journey beginning right in their home city, so they
                    can explore the topic of air pollution around the world from a starting point they can relate to. In
                    this way we hope to better engage our readers, to make them stop and think about the air we all
                    breathe, and to take action to reduce the damaging health effects and loss of human potential caused
                    by dirty air.<br><br><br>


                    <b>Background</b><br>
                    In 2013 air pollution was responsible for an estimated 5.5 million deaths, making it the 4th highest
                    ranking risk factor for death globally. People in every country of the world are impacted by air
                    pollution but it is challenging to convey the scale of the problem in a way that is universally
                    relevant and compelling.<br><br><br>


                    <b>Motivation</b><br>
                    Some of our team members have had the misfortune of living in cities where the air pollution is
                    extremely bad and found it hard to convey how unhealthy the air can be to people who have only lived
                    in cities with relatively clean air. On more than one occasion we have been asked “is the air in
                    Beijing worse than Mexico City?”.

                <p>

                    The idea for using Horizontal bars to represent air pollution came partially from the website
                    Hipmunk, which uses the same approach display flight information. The idea of using position for
                    your most important metric, and the elegance of the Hipmunk visual encoding was further reinforced a
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-oiKt7bUU8">lecture</a> titled “Designing Data
                    Visualization given by Noah Iliinsky at LinkedIn (see video at 37:00)

                    The excellent data visualization documentary The Fallen of World War II (http://www.fallen.io/ww2/ )
                    was an inspiration for how to represent the imapct of human loss from air pollution in an engaging
                    and impactful way.

                <h2>Questions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>How polluted is the air in my city?</b><br>
                    In absolute terms, the concentration of pollutants in any given city is not very revealing. We think
                    readers will be much more engaged and interested if they can compare relative pollution between
                    their own city and others. We think giving the readers this context of a place they know first, will
                    make comparisons more impactful.<br><br>

                    <b>How polluted is the air in my country compared to others?</b><br>
                    This is a natural extension of the question above and by layering this new information on top of the
                    previous city level comparison we build a stronger sense of context.<br><br>

                    <b>Is air pollution really that big of a problem?</b><br>
                    Act 2: Death, will really bring home to the reader the true human cost of air pollution through the
                    lives lost every year.<br><br>

                    <b>What is it like to live in a city with bad air?</b><br>
                    Our section “A year in the life of Beijing’s air” will take readers through a year of pollution,
                    highlighting the impact it has on the daily lives of its residents.<br><br>

                    <b>What causes air pollution?</b><br>
                    Our section “Behind the numbers: factors contributing to pollution” will invite readers to explore
                    this question. This will be supported by additional text and links to air pollution studies.<br><br>

                    <b>What can I do about air pollution?</b><br>
                    Act 3: Action, will inform the reader about what they can do to a) protect themselves from the
                    impacts of air pollution and b) what actions they can take to reduce the problem.<br><br>

                The central visualization for Act 1 shows air pollution data for various cities and countries using
                horizontal bars layered out in a stacked gantt chart style. All of the data for this visualization is
                contained in the following WHO data file:<br><br>

                protect their health from air pollution, and what actions can be taken to help reduce the problem. No
                data visualizations are proposed for this section, but information from the Environmental

                    The cleaned WHO particulate matter dataset consists of the data channels shown below. For each we
                    provide details of any data wrangling performed.<br><br>

                    <b>Region:</b><br>

                        20 Leading Causes of Death</b><br><br>

                    The Causes of Death data was already structured and cleaned by the WHO organization. We only
                    modified the data by adding information of air pollution. There were two tables; the data of 2000
                    and 2012. The 2000 data was dropped completely.<br><br>

                    Removed.<br><br>


                    <b> Deaths per 100.000</b><br>
                    Because the 3.7 million deaths caused by air pollution are diagnosed as other diseases (source),
                    those deaths had to be removed from the totals of the individual diseases to prevent duplicate
                    deaths. The removed counts were added as separate rows with air pollution as their parent. Because
                    of this, it is possible to zoom into the air pollution numbers.<br><br>

                    <b>% Deaths</b><br>
                    After the total deaths (Deaths per 100.000) were recalculated, the percentages were updated to keep
                    the data consistent.

                    We performed an initial check to see which country level metrics available from the World Bank would
                    offer interesting insights for the user. We used Tableau as a tool to perform this analysis because
                    it makes it easy to perform rapid testing of chart results before we jump into coding. An exerpt
                    from the Tableau analysis is shown below:<br>

                    <b>Filter: </b> The initial view presented to the reader will show pollution data filtered for their
                    city of choice.<br>
                    <b>Navigate:</b> After the reader sees information about his city, the visualization zooms out to
                    show information about the whole country. Additionally, when the user clicks on a country, they will
                    be presented with the underlying city level detail.<br>
                    <b>Select:</b> The reader will be able select additional countries to add to the visualization. This
                    will provide the flexibility for the user to choose which country comparisons are most relevant or
                    interesting.<br>
                    <b>Sort:</b> The bar chart with the countries can be sorted based on PM2.5 or PM10.<br>
                    <b>Determine Range: </b>The visual encoding we have chosen uses bars to represent the range of
                    pollution for each country. We think this is an important metric and therefore it is presented using
                    the very effective position encoding.<br>
                    <b>Coordinate:</b> The city that is picked when you enter the page is the main focus of all
                    visualizations. It is the city that will be explored in the beginning, the country that will be used
                    to compare to well known polluters and the city that will be the main focus on the map.<br>
                    <b>Coordinate:</b> In the section “Behind the numbers: factors contributing to pollution” readers
                    will be able to explore coordinated scatter plots showing PM2.5 vs 9 different metrics such as %
                    fossil fuel use, % forestry in country. We also plan to include functionality for simultaneous
                    highlighting and filtering.<br>

                <p>

                    <b>introduction</b><br><br>
                    While working on different parts of the project,
                    we thought it would be a smart idea to add some interactivity in the introduction, to spark interest
                    early. While discussing what to make, an idea came up for showing all country data.
                    We added the country data of multiple years to show that air pollution is still an important issue
                    today.

                </p>
                <div>
                    <b> Act 1: Air</b><br><br>

                    <p>
                        We found several issues with our original design. Labelling the countries turned out to be very
                        tricky since they would easily overlap. For example, if you lived in a country which had a
                        similar PM 2.5 level to the WHO safe level, the labels would overlap. We overcame this by
                        extending the line by 10px based on the index value of the city, which allowed each city added
                        to be longer than the last. This helped but it extended the vertical height of the chart
                        greatly.

                    The beijing visualization has not changed during development, other then a technical change:
                    We went from 'text' elements to 'Foreign Objects' to be able to style and link inside the bullet
                    points.

                    <b> Act 1: All cities</b><br><br>

                    One of us found an article of the NYT <a
                        href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html?_r=0">here</a>,
                    and thought something like it would be a
                    great addition to the project, to show the data of all cities at once. It started with a few
                    drawings.
                    <br>
                    <img class="thumbnail processImg" src="img/act_1_all.png" alt="drawingcities"/>
                    <br>
                    which were translated into a first draft design.
                    <br>
                    <img class="thumbnail processImg" src="img/allcities_1.png" alt="allcities1"/>

                </p>


                <p>
                    <b> Act 2: Death development</b><br><br>
                    <img class="thumbnail processImg" src="img/design_draw1.png" alt="drawing1"/>
                    We first had the problem of how to show external svg files with d3. After some research we were able
                    to show skeletons based on the amount of deaths.<br>
                    Because these skeletons consist of quite some whitespace, hovering and clicking on them was not as
                    easy as it looks. This white space also made it less obvious what the border of each group
                    was.<br><br>
                    <img class="thumbnail processImg" src="img/redesign1.png" alt="skeletons"/>

                    We changed the skeletons to show coffins instead. This made the visualization easier to understand
                    by glancing at it.
                    <img class="thumbnail processImg" src="img/redesign2.png" alt="koffins"/>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Act 3: Act development</b><br><br>
                    <img class="thumbnail processImg" src="img/design_draw2.png" alt="world1"/>
                    At first, we build a flat world map, where you would be zoomed in into the selected city.
                    When we noticed this could cause trouble with cities in the middle of big countries, we added a
                    topojson file which also showed all regions. this file was 9mb.<br><br>

                    Old testversion:
                    <a href="http://mariusdv.nl/tests/mapzoom/">http://mariusdv.nl/tests/mapzoom/ </a> (slow
                    load)<br><br>

                    We later changed the design to a globe and reverted back to the old topojson file.
                    This globe was automatically turned to center your city. After some more brainstorming, we decided
                    that it would be pretty to show your city as a pulsing marker, but also let the globe auto-rotate.
                    which is our current version.

                    <b>Build Automation and Project Bootstrapping</b><br>

                    We decided that we wanted to try our best to follow modern Javascript development best-practices.
                    This included bootstrapping our project with build automation tools and test integration. Before we
                    could start that process, we chose to host our project on GitHub. GitHub will not only host our web
                    page but will also handle all version control. We started a new repository at this location:
                    <a href="https://github.com/free-radicals/AirPollution">https://github.com/free-radicals/AirPollution</a>
                    <br><br>

                    All of these technologies use Node.js to run, which is a Javascript runtime that runs on a local
                    computer. Node has a package manager called NPM. Within NPM, we initialized the project, allowing us
                    to add project dependencies. We first added Gulp, which is a task-runner for Node. Once Gulp was in
                    the repo, we configured it to run JShint, Karma, Jasmine, a CSS minifier, a JS uglifier, Browserify,
                    and live-reload server.<br><br>

                    JShint is a linter that will alert us if we write any Javascript code that is non-standard or
                    error-prone. Karma is a test runner which is configured to run Jasmine tests, used for providing
                    test coverage in our code. We use gulp to move the source copy of our HTML file to the /dist/
                    directory of our repo. At the same time, we copy all CSS into the /dist/ repo, minifying it at the
                    same time to reduce the overall payload. Similarly, our Javascript is bundled up in Browserify,
                    minified, then copied over to /dist/, where the HTML file references it locally. Browserify is nice
                    because it allows us to make our code modular, so we don’t have to cram all of our logic in a single
                    file.<br><br>

                    Lastly, the live-reload server allows us to navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to see the current
                    copy of our application. If any changes are made, this page automatically refreshes. Additionally,
                    Gulp repeats most processes when any code changes occur, so if we introduce a bug in the code it
                    will be caught by JShint or Karma and would show in the live-reload server instantly.<br><br>

                    Now we can easily write quality Javascript code with a lot of tools on our side ensuring we see
                    mistakes being introduced as soon as they happen. All of this (once configured) can be activated
                    easily by typing “gulp” from the project directory:
                    <img class="thumbnail processImg" src="img/implementation1.png" alt="gulp"/>

                    <b>Introduction</b><br>

                    <b>Act 1: Air</b><br>
                <p>
                    Creating this visualization was pretty simple after a bit of exploration. In D3, each datum is a
                    vertical line which is placed on the x coordinate with a simple scale. The tricky part was treating
                    each line differently. Obviously, the user's home city should display differently from the
                    "additional" cities they add to the chart. Given that we handled the current city within our Service
                    object, it meant that we needed to have two sets of data in the chart. This worked, but meant I had
                    to duplicate code more than I liked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chart also required an additional city selector, which meant we had to use typeahead.js again,
                    like we did in the introduction. Because the view and logic code was not decoupled, we had to
                    duplicate the CityPicker class, tweaking it slightly. I wasn't concerned about this duplication at
                    the time, but we discovered that we really had to add the country to the typeahead suggestions for
                    instances like "London, CA" and "London, UK", both showing as "London". Fixing this was more
                    troublesome because it had to be fixed in two places instead of one.
